# Assignment for Unit 5  
### Created by Domenic Taganahan

This project is a Flutter-based calculator application, developed as part of the Unit 5 assignment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment was to build a simple calculator app in Flutter. The following features were implemented:

- **IconButton for Operations (20 points)**  
  An `IconButton` was added to perform the selected operation (Addition) on the two input values and update the sum in the UI.

- **Clear Input and Sum (20 points)**  
  A `TextButton` or `ElevatedButton` was added to clear the user inputs and reset the sum. This feature uses either a `TextEditingController` or `setState` to handle the clearing logic.

- **Additional Operations (30 points)**  
  Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division rows were added below the Addition row, with a similar layout. Each row has a dedicated button for performing its corresponding operation.
